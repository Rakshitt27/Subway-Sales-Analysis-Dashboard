This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Subway's sales performance over a 20-month period. Key metrics include average weekly sales, profit margins, revenue growth rates, and customer retention. The dashboard highlights sales trends across different product categories (footlongs, six-inch sandwiches, sides), cookie sales distribution, and a detailed breakdown of meat sales. 

Additionally, it features a geographic visualization of online order distribution in Melbourne, allowing for a deeper understanding of regional demand. This project offers actionable insights into product performance and customer behavior, supporting data-driven decision-making for sales optimization.
